Your simple and free flashcard studying tool.

This education tool is not yet completed and many of the featues are subject to change. 

Considering the recent trend of charging for essential feature in education tools, which causes a discrepancy in access to education, I wanted to develop a tool to help students learn. Here is a list of upcoming features:
[] create and store flashcard sets
[] view your flashcards in an ordered or random view to refresh your memory
[] generate tests based on your flashcards to learn about your weak spots
[] create an account to store and share your flashcards with your classmates

Here is a list of features currently in development:
[] Create flashcard set and store locally in browser
